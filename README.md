## User Stories
As a User I would like to...
* Enter the name of a city into the input field
* submit the name of the city which to update the DOM with the relevant weather forecasting information

## Future Goals
* incorporate localStorage so that when the user closes the browser and returns, the name of their city will be retrieved to make an api call to update the DOM
* Adjust the background image to compliment each loaded forecast
